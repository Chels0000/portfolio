# A Little About Me
Hi!

I'm new at this but really enjoy data visualization. My name is CS and my pronouns are she,her and hers. Currently I'm pursing a Master of Arts Management at Carnegie Mellon University. This portfolio is representative of my interest in the arts and demonstrates my ability to visually represent data in clear and meaningful ways.  Through this portfolio  you will gain a better understanding of my intrests and how I hope to use such skills to advocate for the arts.

I hold a background in sculplture and jewerly/metals design. I'm a practicing studio arts and hold experience working as a private contractor in exhbition design and installation, as well as art conservation.  Please reach out if you would like to collaborate. 

## What I hope to Learn
Upon graduation I hope to work at the intersection of art and economic development. Through this course I seek to learn how to effectively compile and visually render engaging charts and graphs. I also enjoy learning about how humans take in and disect information as it informs how society interprets and retains information, which is applicable to various areas of life. e

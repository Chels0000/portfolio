This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

#About Me
I'm new at this but really enjoy data visualization. I'm currently pursing a Master's at Carnegie Mellon and hope to work in public art management. This portfolio is representative of my interest in the arts and demonstrates visually issues to better advocate for arts funding and implementation.

My background is in sculplture and jewerly/metals design and hold experience working in conservation and art installation.  Please reach out if you would like to know more about me or my experience in the arts.

#What I hope to Learn
Upon graduation I hope to work at the intersection of art and economic development. Through this course I seek to learn how to effectively compile and visually render engaging charts and graphs.
